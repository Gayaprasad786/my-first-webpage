    <li><h2>Data Structure</h2></li>
    <p>
        <h3>A data structure is a collection of data type 'values' which are stored and organized in such a way that it 
            allows for efficient access and modification. When we think of data structures, there are generally four forms: ...
            Linear: arrays, lists. Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning etc.MY EXPECTATION TO THESE SUBJECT IS TO GIVE 
            ME THE PERFECTION IN PROGRAMMING.</h3>

    <li><h2>C Programing</h2></li>
    <p>
        <h3>C  is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical 
            variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.IT GIVE ME BASIC LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE IN LANGUAGE</h3>
    </p>
    <li><h2>Computer Artitecture and Organization</h2></li>
    <p>
        <h3>Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of internal working, structuring and implementation of a
            computer system. ... Externally visual attributes, here in computer science, mean the way a system is visible 
            to the logic of programs (not the human eyes!).IT GIVES ME THE KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTER IN DEEP.</h3>

    <li><h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2></li>
    <p>
        <h3>Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics dealing with objects that can assume only distinct, separated
            values. ... Whereas discrete objects can often be characterized by integers, continuous objects require real numbers.</h3>
